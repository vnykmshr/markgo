A space for long-form writing, quick thoughts, and interesting links. Built with MarkGo — a blog engine that treats your words as plain files on disk, not rows in a database.

## What You'll Find Here

**Articles** — essays on software, tools, and the craft of building things that work well.

**Thoughts** — short observations that don't need a title or a thesis. Just a sentence or two worth sharing.

**Links** — pointers to writing, projects, and ideas from others that shaped my thinking.

## The Stack

This site runs on [MarkGo](https://github.com/vnykmshr/markgo), a Go blog engine with SPA navigation, offline reading, and instant capture. No database, no JS build step. Markdown in, blog out.
