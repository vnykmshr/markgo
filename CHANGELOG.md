and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

---

## [3.7.0] - 2026-02-15

AMA (Ask Me Anything) — a fourth content type. Readers submit questions via FAB or bottom nav, author moderates and answers from admin, published Q&As flow into the home feed.

### Added

- **AMA content type**: `type: ama` articles with `asker` and `asker_email` frontmatter fields, draft=pending / published=answered workflow
- **AMA submission sheet**: bottom sheet (mobile) / centered modal (desktop) with name, email (optional), question fields, client-side math captcha, honeypot spam prevention, character counter
- **Admin AMA page** (`/admin/ama`): pending question cards with answer textarea, publish and delete actions, live count updates
- **AMA feed card**: distinct card design with "Q" badge, asker attribution, answer excerpt — appears in home feed with dedicated filter pill
- **FAB dual-purpose**: compose button (auth) / AMA question mark button (unauth), keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl+.
- **Bottom nav AMA button**: prominent raised-circle center button for unauthenticated users, dispatches `fab:ama`
- **About page CTA**: "Ask Me Anything" section with trigger button
- **Focus trap utility** (`focus-trap.js`): shared Tab/Shift+Tab trap for modal dialogs, used by both compose-sheet and ama-sheet
- **AMA handler tests**: submission, honeypot, validation, answer publish, delete, edge cases
- **Compose service AMA support**: `LoadArticle` round-trips Asker/AskerEmail/Type fields, `DeletePost` for admin removal

### Fixed

- **Bottom nav login swap**: `swapBottomNavToCompose()` targeted removed `.bottom-nav-subscribe` class — updated to `.bottom-nav-ama`
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict**: changed from Cmd+N (browser "new window") to Cmd+. for compose/AMA trigger
- **Focus trap missing**: compose-sheet and ama-sheet dialogs declared `role="dialog"` without trapping keyboard focus (WCAG violation)

---

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-14

Structural reliability release. No new features. Every change closes a security gap, eliminates an inconsistency class, or removes duplication.

### Added

- **`auth-fetch.js` module**: single source of truth for mutation fetches — CSRF injection, auth error detection, and structured JSON responses
- **Upload rate limiting**: per-endpoint rate limit (20 req/5min production), environment-aware defaults, configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_UPLOAD_*` env vars
- **`abortWithError` middleware helper**: content-negotiated error responses (JSON for API clients, styled HTML for browsers) on all middleware error paths

### Changed

- **Middleware error responses**: all `AbortWithStatus()` calls in session, CSRF, and rate limit middleware replaced with `abortWithError()` — no more empty response bodies
- **CSRF enforcement**: admin route group now has CSRF middleware applied at group level (was per-route opt-in on drafts only)
- **JS fetch consolidation**: compose, compose-sheet, drafts, offline-queue, admin, and contact modules refactored to use `authenticatedFetch`/`authenticatedJSON` — removed 6 duplicate `getCSRFToken` implementations and manual CSRF header injection
- **CSS design token**: extracted `--max-content-width` from 14 hardcoded `42rem` values
- **CollectionPage JSON-LD**: consolidated from inline template logic to handler pattern (tags, categories, archive)
- **Service worker**: cache version bumped to v4 to force invalidation after JS changes

### Fixed

- **`relativeTime` and `timeAgo`**: guard against zero time values (previously displayed "Jan 1, 0001")
- **admin.js CSRF gap**: admin actions (cache clear, etc.) were sending POST requests without CSRF tokens — now injected via `authenticatedJSON`
- **Config leak in JSON error responses**: `renderHTML` no longer serializes full template data (including admin credentials) when returning JSON — extracts only safe fields
- **Template crash on canonical line**: `html/template` `and` function with mixed types (string + bool) halted execution on every page — replaced with nested `{{ if }}` blocks
- **Duplicate SEO meta tags**: per-page `-head` templates now gated by `{{ if not .config.SEO.Enabled }}` to prevent duplicate description/OG/Twitter tags across all public pages (9 templates fixed)
- **About page missing OG description**: handler now sets `description` in template data for proper `og:description` and `twitter:description` generation

---

## [3.5.0] - 2026-02-14

Org migration, Go 1.26, and build improvements.

### Changed

- **Module path**: migrated from `github.com/vnykmshr/markgo` to `github.com/1mb-dev/markgo`
- **Go**: upgraded from 1.25 to 1.26 (go.mod, CI, Docker images)
- **golangci-lint**: bumped to v2.9.0 for Go 1.26 compatibility
- **Dependencies**: updated 17 indirect deps (sonic 1.15, quic-go 0.59, otel 1.40, go-redis 9.17, x/crypto 0.48, x/net 0.50)
- **Version injection**: `AppVersion` is now a single ldflags-injected var — health, logs, CLI, and `--version` all read from the same source

### Fixed

- Stale `cmd/server` references in docker-compose, scripts, and STRESS_TESTING.md
- WebStress references updated to Lobster (current project name)
- `AppVersion` constant was stuck at v3.1.0 — now injected at build time

### Removed

- Unused Codecov integration from CI workflow
- Redundant `serve.Version` variable (consolidated into `constants.AppVersion`)

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-13

UX cohesion, responsive hardening, and auth flow resilience across the SPA.

### Added

- Context-aware UI: compose gated behind auth, visitors see subscribe button in bottom nav
- Subscribe popover for non-authenticated users (header + bottom nav trigger)
- SPA router syncs `data-authenticated` across navigations, dispatches `auth:statechange` on transitions
- Login form event delegation — SPA-swapped auth gate forms now work without full reload
- Offline queue CSRF sentinel (`failed: -1`) distinguishes "no token" from "nothing to drain"
- Design language documentation for responsive cohesion patterns (`docs/design.md`)

### Changed

- Header actions consolidated: search + subscribe hidden on mobile (available in bottom nav/footer)
- Thought cards: accent bar, improved touch targets, better visual hierarchy
- Popover sizing standardized across login, search, subscribe, and theme popovers
- Upload status hint moved below controls row as fine-print text (better mobile readability)
- Bottom nav subscribe button scrolls before opening popover (matches footer pattern)
- FAB keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+N) now registers on both initial auth and reactive auth paths
- Compose sheet uses `initialized` guard to prevent double listener registration on reactive auth
- Active link highlighting consolidated in navigation module (removed duplicate from router)

### Fixed

- CSRF sync after reactive login: awaited before dispatching `auth:authenticated` (closes race window)
- CSRF sync failure now surfaces actionable warning toast instead of silent swallow
- Session expiry fallback changed from `/login` (404) to `window.location.reload()`
- `drainQueue()` guards `openDB()` with try-catch, nil-guards `db.close()` in finally block
- `syncQueue()` wraps `getQueueCount()` in try-catch for IndexedDB unavailability
- Empty catch blocks replaced with `console.debug`/`console.warn` logging (navigation, offline-queue)
- Per-item queue drain errors now logged before stopping

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-13

Article asset uploads, reactive auth, brand identity, and security hardening across the board.

### Added

**Article Asset Uploads**
- Slug-scoped file uploads: images, PDFs, and other assets stored per-article
- Upload UI in compose page with save-first guard, multi-type support, and progress feedback
- Extension-based blocklist (19 executable/script/HTML types) with case-insensitive matching
- Filepath containment check prevents directory traversal attacks
- Random 4-byte hex suffix in filenames prevents collision
- Upload directory writability probe at startup with warning on failure
- Dynamic `maxFileSize` from server config (no hardcoded client-side limit)
- `Content-Disposition: inline` for images, `attachment` for all other uploaded types

**Reactive Authentication**
- Login without page reload — DOM swap preserves SPA state
- Draft recovery toast after login (unsaved work detected)
- Popover module with AbortController lifecycle cleanup
- Search + subscribe header popovers

**Admin & Drafts**
- Admin dashboard with clickable stat tiles and Edit action buttons
- `/admin/writing` page with direct edit links to published articles
- One-click publish from drafts list with fade animation

**Brand Identity**
- Bean Brace brand: logo, favicon, Open Graph images

### Changed

- `fallbackErrorHTML` extracted to `internal/errors.FallbackErrorHTML` (shared between handlers and recovery middleware)
- 3 missing templates added to `requiredTemplates` startup validation (admin_home, category, tag)
- Upload route registers even when directory creation fails (Gin static serves existing files)
- Frontend CSS deduplication and layout consolidation
- Active link management consolidated in navigation module (removed duplicate from router)
- Button hover polish: prevent blue-on-blue text

### Fixed

- CSRF sync after reactive auth DOM swap (popover destroy + fresh token fetch)
- Bare `catch {}` blocks replaced with proper error logging (drafts, compose-sheet)
- Double-invocation guard on draft card removal animation
- `og:image` default wired correctly with deterministic meta tag ordering
- Nav active states, header consistency, tag ordering, article footer

### Security

- Upload blocklist expanded to 19 types (scripts, HTML-renderable, Java archives)
- Upload filepath containment via `filepath.Abs` + prefix check
- Upload config validation: empty path rejected, max size enforced
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on all uploaded files
- Popover AbortController cleanup prevents event listener leaks

### Testing

- HandleSubmit/HandleEdit: valid, missing-slug, empty-title, frontmatter-error, write-error paths
- refreshCSRFToken: success, cookie-missing, cookie-empty, invalid-format paths
- injectAuthState: authenticated/unauthenticated paths
- PublishDraft reload-failure path test
- AdminHome, Writing, formatDuration, HumansTxt handler tests
- UploadConfig boundary tests (exactly-at-limit, over-limit, empty-path)
- Coverage: 52% → 58.7%

### Removed

- 6 unused `logo-*.png` theme assets (~78KB)
- Dead Twitter meta comment from base.html
- Stale draft-publishing comment from article service

- SessionAware middleware generates CSRF tokens for unauthenticated visitors (enables login popover on all pages)
- SPA router syncs CSRF meta tag and hidden inputs after content swap (prevents SPA desync)
- Compose error responses shown via toast instead of DOM swap (preserves event listeners)

### Security

- CSRF cookie reuse validates token format (64-char hex) before accepting
- CSRF cookie max-age refreshed on reuse to prevent silent expiry
- `isValidCSRFToken()` rejects corrupted, truncated, or injected cookie values

### Removed

- Editorial and bold theme stubs (unused CSS)

**98 commits since v2.3.1**

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-04
