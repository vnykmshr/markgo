### Pull Requests

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vnykmshr/markgo
   cd markgo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and tools**:
   ```bash
   make deps
   make install-dev-tools
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Write your code** following our coding standards
2. **Add tests** for your changes
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Run quality checks**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Runs fmt, vet, lint, and tests
   ```

#### Coding Standards

**Go Code Style**:
- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors properly

**Testing Requirements**:
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage (aim for 80%+)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

**Git Commit Messages**:
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Design first** - consider the API and user experience
2. **Start with tests** - write failing tests for the feature
3. **Implement incrementally** - small, focused commits
4. **Document as you go** - update docs and examples

### Common Tasks

#### Adding a New HTTP Handler

1. Create handler function in `internal/handlers/`
2. Add route in handler setup
3. Add tests in `*_test.go` files
4. Update API documentation

#### Adding Configuration Options

1. Add field to config struct in `internal/config/`
2. Update `.env.example` with new option
3. Add validation if needed
4. Document in configuration guide

#### Adding a New Service

1. Define interface in `internal/services/interfaces.go`
2. Implement service in `internal/services/`
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Update dependency injection in main

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. **Version bump** following semantic versioning
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with new features and fixes
3. **Create release tag** with release notes
4. **Build and publish** release artifacts
