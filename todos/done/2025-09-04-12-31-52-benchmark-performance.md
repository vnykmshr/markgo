# Benchmark Performance
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 92368

## Original Todo
**Benchmark Performance**: Establish baseline metrics and comparison with competitors

## Description
Create comprehensive performance benchmarks to establish baseline metrics for MarkGo and validate competitive performance claims. This includes implementing integration benchmarks, load testing scenarios, competitor comparison tests, and enhanced performance monitoring to demonstrate MarkGo's advantages over Ghost, WordPress, Jekyll, and Hugo.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create comprehensive benchmark test suite with integration tests for full request flows
- [x] Add performance monitoring middleware to track response times and resource usage
- [x] Implement load testing scenarios for concurrent users and high-traffic conditions  
- [x] Create competitor comparison benchmark script with specific targets (<50ms response time, >1000 req/s throughput)
- [x] Add memory profiling and resource usage benchmarks with baseline measurement
- [x] Integrate performance regression testing into CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Document benchmark results and competitive analysis for stakeholders
- [x] Automated test: Run benchmark suite and validate performance targets are met
- [x] User test: Review benchmark results and confirm competitive positioning claims
