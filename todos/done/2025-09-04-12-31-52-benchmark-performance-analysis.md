    return gin.HandlerFunc(func(c *gin.Context) {
        start := time.Now()
        c.Next()
        duration := time.Since(start)
        // Log/expose metrics
    })
}

// Add to handlers for detailed metrics
func (h *Handlers) DetailedMetrics(c *gin.Context) {
    // Include response times, memory usage, goroutine count
    // Cache hit/miss ratios, request throughput
}
```

### 6. **Performance Testing in CI/CD** (Priority: Medium)
```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions or similar

# Comprehensive Competitor Analysis: Performance Benchmarks and Metrics

Based on extensive research of MarkGo's main competitors, here is a detailed analysis of performance benchmarks and metrics that can serve as baseline comparisons for establishing MarkGo's competitive advantages.

## Executive Summary

MarkGo's claims of "sub-100ms response times" and "10x better performance than Ghost" appear well-positioned based on the competitive landscape analysis. The research reveals significant performance gaps between different platform architectures, with static generators leading in build performance and Go-based solutions demonstrating superior runtime characteristics.

## 1. Hugo (Static Site Generator)

### Performance Metrics
- **Build Time**: 
  - 1,000 pages: ~2.1 seconds (2.1ms per page average)
  - 7,500 pages: ~13 seconds (Smashing Magazine case study)
  - Development rebuild: ~50ms for changes
  
- **Memory Usage**: 
  - Build-time only (generates static files)
  - Historical data: Earlier versions required significant resources for very large sites (600K articles needed 60GB RAM)
  - Modern versions: Significantly optimized with streaming builds

- **Response Time**: 
  - Static files: <10ms (CDN-dependent)
  - No runtime server processing required

- **Resource Requirements**:
  - CPU: Minimal (build-time only)
