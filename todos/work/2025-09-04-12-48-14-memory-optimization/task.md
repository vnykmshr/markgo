# Memory Optimization
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 92368

## Original Todo
**Memory Optimization**: Profile memory usage and optimize for lower footprint

## Description
Profile memory usage patterns and implement optimizations to reduce MarkGo's memory footprint from ~50-60MB to <30MB target. Focus on high-impact optimizations including article content deduplication, string interning, cache compression, and template data pooling to achieve 10x better memory efficiency than Ghost (~300MB) while maintaining performance.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Implement article content deduplication with lazy loading for ProcessedContent and Excerpt (internal/models/article.go, internal/services/article.go)
- [ ] Add string interning system for frequently repeated strings (tags, categories, authors) (internal/utils/string_intern.go)  
- [ ] Implement cache compression with gzip for stored values (internal/services/cache.go)
- [ ] Create template data pooling to reduce gin.H map allocations (internal/handlers/handlers.go)
- [ ] Add pre-compiled regex caching for excerpt generation (internal/services/article.go)
- [ ] Implement string builder pooling for efficient string operations (internal/utils/string_builder.go)
- [ ] Add memory-aware cache eviction policies based on heap usage (internal/services/cache.go)
- [ ] Update memory benchmarks with new 30MB target validation (internal/handlers/benchmark_memory_test.go)
- [ ] Automated test: Run memory benchmarks and validate <30MB footprint target
- [ ] User test: Monitor production memory usage and confirm 10x improvement over Ghost
